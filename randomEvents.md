# Random events [WIP] #
## How they work ?
For every 150 turns, a random event will occur. These are NOT known by the players and are listed below :

## What are they ?
**[0] Money Galore**
Every tile will receive +2$ (does not exceed the 10 limit)

**[1] Sharpness V**
For the next 20 turns, every entity will have its attack doubled

**[2] Prot IV**
For the next 20 turns, every entity will be invincible

**[3] Oversized**
For the next 20 turns, every entity will have its capacity doubled. Once going back to normal, the excess money will not be discarded

**[4] AMERICAAAAAA- (sorry)**
For the next 20 turns, every entity can pump 2 resources from a tile

**[5] Unlimited Power**
For the next 20 turns, pumping will not consume resources on the map (still requires a tile to have at least one resource to work)

**[6] Robbery**
For the next 20 turns, ramming into an enemy depot will steal their resources
