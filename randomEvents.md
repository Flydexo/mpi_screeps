# Random events [NOT IMPLEMENTED YET] #
## How they work ?
For every 150 turns, a random event will occur. These are NOT known by the players and are listed below :

## What are those, Johnny ?
**Money Galore**
Every tile will receive +2$ (does not exceed the 10 limit)

**Sharpness V**
For the next 10 turns, every entity will have its attack doubled

**Oversized**
For the next 10 turns, every entity will have its capacity doubled. Once going back to normal, the excess money will not be discarded

**AMERICAAAAAA- (sorry)**
For the next 10 turns, every entity can pulp 2 resources from a tile

**Prot IV**
For the next 10 turns, every entity will be invincible

**Unlimited Power**
For the next 10 turns, pumping will not consume resources on the map (still requires a tile to have at least one resource to work)

**Endless Pit**
For the next 10 turns, four golden tiles will appear at the center (ans not despawn until the 10 turns are over). Pumping from one of those will fill the capacity of the entity to the maximum amoint possible

**Robbery**
For the next 20 turns, ramming into an enemy depot will steal their resources
